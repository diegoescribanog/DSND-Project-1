## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The project makes use of the following Python packages: 

- Pandas: Library used to analyze data and deal with dataframes. It is installed by default in the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
- Geopandas: Library used to facilitate the work with geospatial data. It isn't installed by default in the Anaconda distribution of Python, but it is easy to include it following the instructions [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/geopandas). 
- Country converter: Library used to convert and match country names between different classifications and between different naming versions. It isn't installed by default in the Anaconda distribution of Python, but it is easy to include it following the instructions [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/country_converter). 
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries used to create different visualizations. They are installed by default in the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the requirements for Unit 1 in Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. 

As a potential Data Scientist, I am interested in understanding the future of the profession, especially with regard to salaries and the possibilities of working remotely. In particular, I have used the Data Science Job Salaries dataset published on Kaggle (and publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?datasetId=2268489&sortBy=voteCount)) to answer the following questions: 

1. How the possibilities to work remotely for Data Science positions have evolved over the last years? 
2. Are the salaries for Data Science positions increasing in the last years?
3. Are the salaries lower for remote Data Science positions? 
4. Which continents in the world have the highest salaries? And the lowest? 
5. Is the remote culture allowing people to work for companies based on other continents? Where do these companies and employees come from? 
6. Are there differences in the salary of employees working for a company based on a different continent? What is the tendency? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of them is explored in a different section, which can be easily differentiated by the Markdown titles. The folder *Images* contains the resulting files from the analysis. These images can be used to obtain answers to the questions. 

Aditionally, there is one folder named *Data* that contains the dataset used for the project.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code are explored in depth at the post *"The future of Data Science positions: a look at the evolution of remote career options"* available here
